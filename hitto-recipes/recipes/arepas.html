<h2>IT'S CORN!</h2>
<h3>The best comfort food which is also super-nutritious.<br>
    I will teach you how to make this delicious and easy meal that hits the spot ANYTIME.</h3>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Pre-cooked Corn Flour, preferibly Harina Pan <em>(Note: Can be also tamale flour)</em></li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Cheese of your preference</li>
    <li>Ham or any other meat you got laying in the fridge <em>(Note: Next to Puttanesca Pasta, this is the second best thing to do with leftovers)</em></li>
    <li>Butter or any dressing of your choice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mix the corn-flour with water and salt until reaching a moldable texture, like dough or playdough, I don't judge.</li>
    <li>Make little round circles about the size of a burger patty, up to you how thicc. Remember you will open to fill so try not to make them too thin.</li>
    <li>Slap them onto a pan, you can use oil and medium flame, or no oil and low flame. <em>Deep fried is also an option.</em></li>
    <li>Once you reached a nice golden color, or you can see that it's solid, let them cool for a little bit.</li>
    <li>Slice that delicious arepa in the middle and stuff it with whatever you got lying around.</li>
    <li>Try to eat only 2... <em>try.</em></li>
</ol>

<h3>Remember, the secret here is creativity. Here's a menu of the classic Venezuelan arepas.</h3>
