<h2>Make those chickens proud!</h2>
<h3>This is the best thing you could ever do with chicken. Scientists studied for millenias and all came to the same conclusion.<br>
Let me teach you how to make the entire world around you happy to know you.</h3>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Chicken breast or any chicken filet. Don't use pigeons, too many fleas.</li>
    <li>Fresh red tomatoes.</li>
    <li>Onion</li>
    <li>Garlic... All the garlic.</li>
    <li>Salt, black and white pepper, oregano.</li>
    <li>Mozarella cheese (and some cheddar if you got lying around.</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Breadcrumbs or bread powder</li>
    <li>Oil... Cooking Oil.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Gotta make that sauce.</li>
    <li>Don't worry, it's easy. Mash the tomatoes and cook them in a pot with low heat for about an hour or so.</li>
    <li>Add seasoning, and some oregano as well as chopped garlic.</li>
    <li>Season the chicken with the spices listed, leave the oregano for later.</li>
    <li>Whip some egg in a bowl, and put another bowl next to it with the breadcrumbs.</li>
    <li>Dip the meat in the mixed egg, later place it on the breadcrumbs, flip it until the coverage is absolute. <em>(Some people like to add crushed doritos or whatever here, that's insane but works.)</em></li>
    <li>In a pre-heated pan, with your cooking oil of choice, place the chicken and let it cook in low flame, don't want any of that salmonella in your delicious meal.</li>
    <li>Once it's golden on both sides, this is where it gets fun, get a spoonful of that delicious marinated tomato sauce and splash that chicken, don't be shy, splash it good.</li>
    <li>Doesn't end there...ADD THE CHEESE on top and cover the pan with a lid. <em>Make sure you're low-heating this, don't go pyro.</em></li>
    <li>When you see that the cheese is melted, it's ready. You're ready. The world is ready.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Most people like to accompany this with white-sauce pasta, not bad, but my pick is with mashed potatoes. Nothing like wrestling that chicken with the potatoes. Delicious.</h3>
<h2>MASH IT UP!</h2>
